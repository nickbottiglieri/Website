                                                As a sophomore in college, SightGain really took a chance on me. I was still learning the foundational 
                                                computer science principles and had a chance to work for the first time on a full stack web application.

                                            <p>
                                                I learned NodeJS, Express, React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and the basics of how a web application works 
                                                before I became a Junior in college.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                When I came back after Junior year, I was truly ready to step up and make a difference on the team.
                                                During my Junior year of college & during this internship I felt like a real developer for the first time. 
                                                I felt like I understood and could work on any task from the database to the html.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Working at a face paced startup was extemely exciting, waking up every morning with the opportunity to solve a new problem.
                                                Sometimes I had no idea what the day had in store for me, which can be incredibly fun. I traveled onsite to Andrew's Air Force
                                                Base to gather requirements, watching how the end user interacted with the app we had been creating, and noting improvements to make.
                                                SightGain was a perfect introduction to the entire software developement process from the ground up and I'm thankful for my small 
                                                team of knowledgeable mentors.

                                                projects that kept me motivated and eager to pursue greater things.
